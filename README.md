## Project Background  
You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements ona page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.  
As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developinguntil now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.  
Assignment prompt is found in [Module 11 Challenge.pdf](/Module%2011%20Challenge.pdf).

## Deliverables
1. Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles:  see file [part_1_mars_news.ipynb](/code/part_1_mars_news.ipynb)
2. Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table: see file [part_2_mars_weather.ipynb](/code/part_2_mars_weather.ipynb)

## Analysis
<font size="3">**Analyze your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:**</font>

1. How many months exist on Mars?
2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
    * Find the average the minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
    * Plot the results as a bar chart.
4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
    * Find the average the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
    * Plot the results as a bar chart.
5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
    * Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
    * Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
